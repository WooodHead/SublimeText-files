My packages and settings for the Sublime Text 2 text editor.
Since I used TextMate before, it contains a lot of key mappings and stuff to make Sublime Text behave identically. Works pretty well so far.

Sublime Text settings live at ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2, put the stuff there.
